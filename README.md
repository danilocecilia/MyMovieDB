# MyMovieDB
ItÂ´s all about a watched movie library.

This Readme contains the step by step on how to commit the files to github and also make clone of my project using only command line,
As soon as I get used to it I will remove these instructions.

Thanks!

Copy the repo link of your choice (I prefer ssh, but it depends on how far you went with the set up part) and head to the terminal.

#cd ~/project-path-here
#git init
#git add .
#git commit -am "initial commit"
#git remote add origin <your link>
#git push -u origin master
If all has gone well, you can reload the github page and see your new push.

On your other computer, you'll be able to clone down the repo you created.

#cd ~/project-path-here
git clone <your link>
You can then use git pull and git push to retrieve and send changes to the server.
